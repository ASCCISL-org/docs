> ## Introduction
>
> Since this project is a retry/restart of MAASL, I think it has also become clear that I haven't been in the programming world lately. This is probably my last concept to turn into a project. And on top of that, this project is the first (well, MAASL is basically this project, but with a different approach.) started with the goal to make something that isn't just a tool, and something that I knew how to create. I truly have no idea on how to build an interpreter for it.
>
> ## My experience and motivation
>
> In the past, as you can see, I have written mostly Batch. Batch is not a programming language, but called parts of code that I wrote in other languages. Unfortunately, I am not the best programmer, so I could not write a complete program in a civilized programming language.
>
> I do know a bit JAVA, VBScript, Rust and Python, especially my recent encounters of JAVA have re-inspired me to write this, because of the whole project, this README.MD file will be the core. Instead of writing code and explaining it afterwards, this project will first have an explanation of what has to happen, and the code afterwards.
