# Hello world 2

A simple script outputting the famous "Hello World", but with your name in it too.

`helloworld2.CiCIs:`

````CiCIscript
.: name=Mark
.tell{text:'Hello world, %name%';target:con;nl=1}
.end
````

## Breakdown

### [The dot](https://asccisl-org.github.io/docs/Commands/dot/)

> The dot refers to internal command, these are the commands that are  always included in CiCIâ€™s basis. Internal commands should always be  called using a dot and directly after the name of the command, without  any spaces or other tokens in between.

See: <https://asccisl-org.github.io/docs/Commands/dot/>

### [tell](https://asccisl-org.github.io/docs/Commands/dot/dottell)

> Tell is the internal command that outputs text, tell knows a couple of arguments.
>
> ###### text
>
> _text_ is the easiest part, it tells _tell_ what text to print. 
>
> ###### target
>
> _target_ accepts either `con`, a device-name to send the text string to, or a specific file path.
>
> **examples:**
>
> ````
> ,sends it to the console, which is default for most languages
> target:con;
> 
> ,sends it to lcdscreen1, if that lcd screen supports direct text input.
> target:lcdscreen1;
> 
> ,sends it to myfile.txt on the oompa drive
> target:'/MEDIA/mark/oompa/myfile.txt'
> ````
>
> ###### nl
>
> *nl* sets a newline, using a boolean value that contains either `1` or `0`, for true or false. The newline will always be printed before the text value. *.tell* without the *nl*-argument, will always fall back to it's standard value 1.
>
> Example:
>
>
> ```CiCIScript
> .tell{text:'Hello';target:con;nl=1}
> .tell{text:' world';target:con;nl=0}
> ```
>
> will output 
>
> ```text
> Hello world
> ```
>
> but
>
> ```CiCIScript
> .tell{text:'Hello';target:con;nl=1}
> .tell{text:' world';target:con;nl=0}
> ```
>
> will output 
>
> ```text
> Hello
> world
> ```
>
> Which is probably not the goal to achieve in this case.

### [:](https://asccisl-org.github.io/docs/Commands/dot/dotcolon/)

> The double dot sets variables, these are standard saved as a string, but if containing a number they will be able to be altered.
>
> ###### Setting variables using :
>
> Some examples.
>
> For a single word variable, use
>
> ```
> .: word=single
> ```
>
> for a string, the same logics can be used.
>
> ```
> .: sentence="hi I am not single, I am with nine."
> ```
>
> String variables are written to a temporary file (`(temp folder)/CiCISessions/(session).tmp/vars/(varname).cicivar`) until being called and then erased from RAM as soon as they seem unused.
>
> For numbers (and automatically 0/1 booleans too), there's more.
>
> ###### Using permactive variables using .:#
>
> Although a number containing string can be sent to any command that supports numbers, sometimes a number might look like a string for the computer.
>
> A full number can be set like `.: number=20` and CiCI will automatically save it as a number.  `.: number=2,0` , though, can be problematic. There's a solution for both!
>
> 
>
> >  In programming languages, numbers are typically split into 32-bit numbers, and 64-bit numbers. In Batch, you had to evoke PowerShell to be able to use 64-bit numbers. And in JAVA the variables of numbers and of what it calls '`doubles`'  are two entirely different things. 32-bit numbers and 64-bit numbers.
> >
> >  In CiCI, variables are not saved in ram, but put directly into a temporary file (`(temp folder)/CiCISessions/(session).tmp/vars/(varname).cicivar`).
> >
> >  This might slow down CiCIscripts a lot, especially in case of number variables. And that's where .:# comes in. It defines a number, not a string. Even though it won't change the way the variable can be called it does make CiCI aware that is a number that needs to be in the RAM, and CiCI will have to figure out what type of number it is.
>
> 
>
> `.:#` defines a variable, to save it to the RAM instead of to the temp folder. Permactive variables can only contain numbers, which makes them usefull to calculate with.
>
> ```
> .: num=1
> .: num+=3
> .tell{text:%num%;target:con;nl=0}
> ```
>
> and
>
> ```
> .:# num=1
> .:# num+=3
> .tell{text:%num%;target:con;nl=0}
> ```
>
> Would both output `4`. But the latter would be able to do so at a much higher speed, especially on a hard drive.
>
> To permactivate a set variable, just use  `.:# var`. To put a variable to stand-bye (the usual state, and the standard state for strings), `.: # var` will do.
>
> Altering an permactive variable with plain `.:` will stand-bye it too, since it just saves it differently, the contrary is not possible, for `.:#` needs to be sure it sets numbers.

### [end](https://asccisl-org.github.io/docs/Commands/dot/dotend)

> `.end` is used at the end of scripts or routines to indicate the end of file is achieved, sometimes even when there's unused code ahead.
>
> [end is an internal command.](https://asccisl-org.github.io/docs/Commands/dot/)
